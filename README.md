# FAT
Font tool

What & Why?

Core Text was always an interesting API that I never had much exposure to, so I'm using this project to explore.

This project was originally called Font Alignment Tool, then became Font Analysis Tool. I became obsessed with fonts while working on a project using AutoLayout and I couldn't align center y with a UILabel and a custom font. After reading [the true type reference manual](https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/) I realized fonts were sort of the wild west. After becoming obsessed with fonts I was going to shorten the Analysis part of the project name, but thought that might be a little bit offensive. Since Apple recommends using [2-3 letter abreviations](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CodingGuidelines/Articles/NamingMethods.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001282-1003829-BCIBDJCA) I was using `fat_` as my method prefix, so I chaged the whole project to be called FAT.


Also note: I'm not a big fan of the stock Container Controllers I usually like a bit more control, and also really like building from scratch (I tend to learn more this way), so I wrote my own for this project.

Everything here is a work in progress, until it dies.

_"I don't like that word 'finish'. When something is finished, that means it's dead, doesn't it? I believe in everlastingness. I never finish a painting – I just stop working on it for a while. I like painting because it's something I never come to the end of. Sometimes I paint a picture, then I paint it all out. Sometimes I'm working on fifteen or twenty pictures at the same time. I do that because I want to – because I like to change my mind so often. The thing to do is always to keep starting to paint, never finishing painting." -Arshile Gorky_
